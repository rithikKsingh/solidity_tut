### Project setup
create a new folder(ex- foundry-fund-me) -> move to it -> ```forge init```

---

### smart contracts testing
  
#### Counter.sol

It's a simple smart contract that stores a number. You have a function to `setNumber` where you specify a `newNumber` which is a `uint256`, and store it, and you have a function to `increment` the number.

**Note:** `number++` is equivalent to `number = number + 1`.

#### Counter.s.sol

Just a placeholder, it doesn't do anything

#### Counter.t.sol

This is the interesting part. We haven't talked that much about carrying tests using Foundry. This is an essential step for any project. The `test` folder will become our new home throughout this course.

Please run the following command in your terminal:

```Solidity
forge test
```

After the contracts are compiled you will see an output related to tests:

* How many tests were found;
* In which file;
* Did they pass or not?;
* Summary;

### How does `forge test` work?

`forge test` has a lot of options that allow you to configure what is tested, how the results are displayed, where is the test conducted and many more!

Run `forge test --help` to explore the options.

In short, in our specific case:

1. Forge identified all the files in the test folder, went into the only file available and ran the `setUp` function.
2. After the setup is performed it goes from top to bottom in search of public/external functions that start with `test`.
3. All of them will be called and the conclusion of their execution will be displayed. By that we mean it will run all the `assert` statements it can find and if all evaluate to `true` then the test will pass. If one of the `assert` statements evaluates to `false` the test will fail.

---
### Finishing the setup

Please delete the `Counter` files that Foundry prepopulated in our new project.

In `src` create two files, `FundMe.sol` and `PriceConverter.sol`.

Go on the [Remix Fund Me repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-fund-me-f23) and copy the contents of both contracts.

Try running `forge compile` or `forge build`. A few errors will pop up. What's the problem?

If you open both the copied smart contracts you will see that up top we `import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";`. This wasn't a problem in Remix because Remix automatically takes care of this problem for you. In Foundry you have to manually install all your dependencies.

`forge install` is the command we are using to install one or multiple dependencies.&#x20;

Call the following:

```Solidity
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
```
in case you dont want to write the version:
```Solidity
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts --no-commit
```

Wait for it to finish.

We used `forge install` to ask Forge to install something in our project. What? We specified the path to a GitHub repository, this also could have been a raw URL. What version? Following the path to a GitHub repository you can add an `@` and then you can specify:

* A branch: master
* A tag: v1.2.3.4 or 0.6.1 in our case
* A commit: 8e8128

If we open the `lib` folder, we can see the `forge-std` which is installed automatically within the `forge init` setup and `chainlink-brownie-contracts` which we just installed. Look through the former, you'll see a folder called `contracts` then a folder called `src`. Here you can find different versions, and inside them, you can find a plethora of contracts, some of which we are going to use in this course. Here we can find the `AggregatorV3Interface` that we are importing in `FundMe.sol`.

But if you open the `FundMe.sol` you'll see that we are importing `{AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";` not from  `/foundry-fund-me-f23/lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol`. How does Foundry know `@chainlink` to half of the path?

Open `foundry.toml`. Below the last line of `[profile.default]` paste the following:

```toml
remappings = ['@chainlink/contracts/=lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/']
```

Now Forge knows to equivalate these. Let's try to compile now by calling `forge compile` or `forge build`.

**Awesome! Everything complies.**

Fixing dependencies in projects is one of the most undesirable things in smart contracts development/audit. Take it slow, make sure you select the proper GitHub repository path, make sure your remappings are solid and they match your imports and everything will be fine!

### Testing

Testing is a crucial step in your smart contract development journey, as the lack of tests can be a roadblock in the deployment stage or during a smart contract audit.

So, buckle up as we unveil what separates the best developers from the rest: comprehensive, effective tests!

Inside the `test` folder create a file called `FundMeTest.t.sol`. `.t.` is a naming convention of Foundry, please use it.

To be able to run tests using Foundry we need to import the set of smart contracts Foundry comes with that contains a lot of prebuilt functions that make our lives 10x easier.

```javascript
import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
```

We also make sure our test contract inherits what we just imported.

```javascript
contract FundMeTest is Test{
```

The next logical step in our testing process is deploying the `FundMe` contract. In the future, we will learn how to import our deployment scripts, but for now, let's do the deployments right in our test file.

We do this inside the `setUp` function. This function is always the first to execute whenever we run our tests. Here we will perform all the prerequisite actions that are required before doing the actual testing, things like:

* Deployments;
* User addresses;
* Balances;
* Approvals;
* And various other operations depending on what's required to initiate the tested contracts.

But before that, please create another function, called `testDemo`.

Your test contract should look like this:

```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract FundMeTest is Test {

    function setUp() external { }

    function testDemo() public { }
}
```

Now run `forge test` in your terminal. This command has a lot of options, you can find more about those [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cli/forge/test?highlight=forge%20test#forge-test).

Our (empty) test passed! Great!

Ok, but how does it work? What's the order of things?

Please update the contract to the following:

```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract FundMeTest is Test {

    uint256 favNumber = 0;
    bool greatCourse = false;

    function setUp() external { 
        favNumber = 1337;
        greatCourse = true;
    }

    function testDemo() public { 
        assertEq(favNumber, 1337);
        assertEq(greatCourse, true);
    }

 }
```
Call `forge test` again.

As you can see our test passed. What do we learn from this?

1. We declare some state variables.
2. Next up `setUp()` is called.
3. After that forge runs all the test functions.

Another nice way of testing this and also an important tool for debugging is `console.log`. The `console` library comes packed in the `Test.sol` that we imported, we just need to update the things we import to this:

```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract FundMeTest is Test {

    uint256 favNumber = 0;
    bool greatCourse = false;

    function setUp() external { 
        favNumber = 1337;
        greatCourse = true;
        console.log("This will get printed first!");
    }

    function testDemo() public { 
        assertEq(favNumber, 1337);
        assertEq(greatCourse, true);
        console.log("This will get printed second!");
        console.log("Updraft is changing lives!");
        console.log("You can print multiple things, for example this is a uint256, followed by a bool:", favNumber, greatCourse);
    }

 }
```
`forge test` has an option called verbosity. By controlling this option we decide how verbose should the output of the `forge test` be. The default `forge test` has a verbosity of 1. Here are the verbosity levels, choose according to your needs:

```

Given that we want to see the printed logs, we will call forge test -vv (the number of v's indicates the level).

```bash
Ran 1 test for test/FundMe.t.sol:FundMeTest
[PASS] testDemo() (gas: 9482)
Logs:
  This will get printed first!
  This will get printed second!
  Updraft is changing lives!
  You can print multiple things, for example this is a uint256, followed by a bool: 1337 true


Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 422.20µs (63.30µs CPU time)
```
### Testing FundMe

Delete `testDemo`. Make a new function called `testMinimumDollarIsFive`. As the name states, we will test if the `MINIMUM_USD` is equal to `5e18`.

```javascript
    function testMinimumDollarIsFive() public {
        assertEq(fundMe.MINIMUM_USD(), 5e18);
    }
```
Run it with `forge test`.

```bash
[⠰] Compiling...
[⠆] Compiling 1 files with 0.8.25
[⠰] Solc 0.8.25 finished in 827.51ms
Compiler run successful!

Ran 1 test for test/FundMe.t.sol:FundMeTest
[PASS] testMinimumDollarIsFive() (gas: 5453)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 487.20µs (43.20µs CPU time)
```

### Writing Deploy Scripts

When we went straight to testing, we left behind a very important element: deploy scripts. Why is this important you ask? Because we need a certain degree of flexibility that we can't obtain in any other way, let's look through the two files `FundMe.sol` and `PriceConverter.sol`, we can see that both have an address (`0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306`) hardcoded for the AggregatorV3Interface. This address is valid, it matches the AggregatorV3 on Sepolia but what if we want to test on Anvil? What if we deploy on mainnet or Arbitrum? What then?

The deploy script is the key to overcome this problem!

Create a new file called `DeployFundMe.s.sol` in `script` folder. Please use the `.s.sol` naming convention.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {FundMe} from "../src/FundMe.sol";

contract DeployFundMe is Script {
    function run() external {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        new FundMe();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```
run : forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol

*** Do we want to use our deploy scripts in our test suites?

Yes, we also want to test the way we deploy our smart contract
