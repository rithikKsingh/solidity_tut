Q. What is Remix IDE?
A. This is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), a powerful tool used to build and develop smart contracts in Solidity. 
   It helps to easily visualize and interact with our smart contracts. It contains a file explorer that hosts all the files, 
   a Solidity compiler and a tab where you can deploy your contracts.

Q. Compiler directive
A. The `pragma` directive specifies the _version_ of the Solidity compiler that you want to use to build your source file. 
   When the compiler encounters this line, it will check its version against the one you specified here. 
   If the compiler version is different, Remix will automatically adjust accordingly to your specifications.

   1 use exactly One version:
   pragma solidity 0.8.19; // use only version 0.8.19

   2 use versions that fall within a lower and upper range
   // use versions between 0.8.19 and 0.9.0 (excluded)
   pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
   pragma solidity >=0.8.19 <0.9.0;

Q. SPDX License Identifier
A. It's a good practice (even not mandatory) to start your smart contract with an SPDX License Identifier. 
   It helps in making licensing and sharing code easier from a legal perspective.

   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

   The MIT license is recognized as one of the most permissive, granting anyone the freedom to use the following code and essentially use it as they see fit.

Q. What is Compiling?
A. Compiling your code means taking **human-readable code and transforming it into **computer-readable code or bytecode.
