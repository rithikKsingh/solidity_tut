### Creating a New Project

The way you [create a new Foundry project](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/creating-a-new-project) is by running the `forge init` command. This will create a new Foundry project in your current working directory.

If you want Foundry to create the new project in a new folder type `forge init nameOfNewFolder`.

Keep in mind that by default `forge init` expects an empty folder. If your folder is not empty you must run `forge init --force .`


And that's it, your folder should look as follows:

`lib` is the folder where all your dependencies are installed, here you'll find things like:

* `forge-std` (the forge library used for testing and scripting)
* `openzeppelin-contracts` is the most battle-tested library of smart contracts
* and many more, depending on what you need/install

`scripts` is a folder that houses all your scripts

`src` is the folder where you put all your smart contracts

`test` is the folder that houses all your tests

`foundry.toml` - gives configuration parameters for Foundry
