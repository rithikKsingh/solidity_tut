### Creating a New Project

The way you [create a new Foundry project](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/creating-a-new-project) is by running the `forge init` command. This will create a new Foundry project in your current working directory.

If you want Foundry to create the new project in a new folder type `forge init nameOfNewFolder`.

Keep in mind that by default `forge init` expects an empty folder. If your folder is not empty you must run `forge init --force .`


And that's it, your folder should look as follows:

<img width="619" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 3 29 25 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54df063a-f4e1-439a-852e-86358539cfb7" />

`lib` is the folder where all your dependencies are installed, here you'll find things like:

* `forge-std` (the forge library used for testing and scripting)
* `openzeppelin-contracts` is the most battle-tested library of smart contracts
* and many more, depending on what you need/install

`scripts` is a folder that houses all your scripts

`src` is the folder where you put all your smart contracts

`test` is the folder that houses all your tests

`foundry.toml` - gives configuration parameters for Foundry

### Compiling Smart Contracts: A Guide to the Foundry Console Compilation Process

Open a new terminal. Type in `forge build` or `forge compile` to compile the smart contracts in your project.

Once the compiling is finished, you'll see some new folders in the Explorer tab on the left side. One of them is a folder called `out`. Here you'll be able to find the [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html) of the smart contract together with the [Bytecode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-bytecode-and-opcode-in-solidity/) and a lot of useful information.

The `cache` folder also appears. Generally, this folder is used to store temporary system files facilitating the compilation process. But for this course, you can safely ignore it.

### Deploying a smart contract

There are multiple ways and multiple places where you could deploy a smart contract.

While developing using the Foundry framework the easiest and most readily available place for deployment is Anvil.

Anvil is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry. You can use it for testing your contracts from frontends or for interacting over RPC.

To run Anvil you simply have to type `anvil` in the terminal.

You now have access to 10 test addresses funded with 10\_000 ETH each, with their associated private keys.

This testnet node always listens on `127.0.0.1:8545` this will be our `RPC_URL` parameter when we deploy smart contracts here. More on this later!

### Ganache
Ganache is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum and Filecoin distributed application development. You can use Ganache across the entire development cycle; enabling you to develop, deploy, and test your dApps in a safe and deterministic environment.


### Configuring MetaMask

To deploy to a custom network (like your localhost), you'll need MetaMask. MetaMask is a popular cryptocurrency wallet and browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem.

Follow these steps:

1. Open MetaMask.

2. Click the three little dots and select 'Expand View'.

3. Go to 'Settings', then 'Networks'.

4. Here, you'll see the list of networks (Ethereum, Mainnet, etc.) with plenty of details about each one. Locate the RPC URL - this is key.

The RPC URL is essentially the endpoint we make API calls to when sending transactions. For every blockchain transaction you execute, you're making an API to whatever is in here.
To send a transaction to your custom blockchain, you need to add it as a network:

1. Click on 'Add a Network'

2. Scroll to the bottom of the list of networks.

3. Hit 'Add a Network manually'.

4. Enter the details of your local network

   Network name: `Localhost`

   New RPC URL: Ganache`http://127.0.0.1:7545` or Anvil `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (make sure you always add `http://`) - these two could differ on your machine, please consult the Ganache UI or Anvil terminal for the exact RPC URL.

   Chain ID: Ganache `5777`(sometimes `1337`) or Anvil `31337` - these two could differ on your machine, please consult the Ganache UI or Anvil terminal for the exact Chain ID.

   Currency symbol: ETH

   Block explorer URL: - (we don't have a block explorer for our newly created blockchain, which will most likely disappear when we close the VS Code / Ganache app)

Great! Now that we configured our local network, the next step is to add one of the accounts available in Ganche or Anvil into our MetaMask. [This is done as follows](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-account#h_01G01W07NV7Q94M7P1EBD5BYM4):

1. Click the account selector at the top of your wallet.

2. Click `Add account or hardware wallet`.

3. Click `Import account`

4. You will be directed to the Import page. Paste your Ganache/Anvil private key. Click `Import`.

**NOTE: Do not use this account for anything else, do not interact with it or send things to it on mainnet or any other real blockchain, use it locally, for testing purposes. Everyone has access to it.**

### Deploying to a local blockchain

To find out more about forge's capabilities type

```Solidity
forge --help
```

Out of the resulting list, we are going to use the `create` command.

Type `forge create --help` in the terminal or go [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create) to find out more about the available configuration options.

Try running `forge create SimpleStorage`. It should fail because we haven't specified a couple of required parameters:

1. `Where do we deploy?`

2. `Who's paying the gas fees/signing the transaction?`

Let's tackle both these questions.

Each blockchain (private or public) has an RPC URL (RPC SERVER) that acts as an endpoint. When we tried to deploy our smart contract, forge tried to use `http://localhost:8545/`, which doesn't host any blockchain. Thus, let's try to deploy our smart contract specifying the place where we want to deploy it.

Start Ganache and press `Quickstart Ethereum`. Copy the RPC Server `HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545`. Let's run our forge create again specifying the correct rpc url.

```
forge create SimpleStorage --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:7545
```

This again failed, indicating the following:

```Solidity
Error accessing local wallet. Did you set a private key, mnemonic or keystore?
```

Try the following command:

```Solidity
forge create SimpleStorage --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:7545 --interactive
```

You will be asked to enter a private key, please paste one of the private keys available in Ganache. When you paste a key you won't see the text or any placeholder symbols, just press CTRL(CMD) + V and then ENTER.

You can go to Ganache and check the `Blocks` and `Transactions` tabs to see more info about what you just did.

On Anvil
Do the following:

1. Run `clear`
2. Run `anvil`
3. Create a new terminal by pressing the `+` button
4. Copy one of the private keys from the anvil terminal
5. Run `forge create SimpleStorage --interactive`
   We don't need to specify an `--rpc-url` this time because forge defaults to Anvil's RPC URL.
   (If that doesn't work, use `forge create SimpleStorage --interactive --broadcast`.It's a new command)
7. Go to the Anvil terminal and check the deployment details:

The more explicit way to deploy using `forge create` is as follows:

```Solidity
forge create SimpleStorage --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

We included the `--rpc-url` to not count on the default and the `--private-key` to not use the `--interactive` option anymore.


### Practicing Private Key Safety

Having a private key in plain text is extremely bad. The private key(s) we used in the last lesson are well-known keys for local testing, you shouldn't use those on mainnet and keeping them in plain text is ok, but any other private key should be kept hidden, especially your production key or key's associated with accounts that hold crypto.

Moreover, it's very bad to have private keys in bash history (hit the up arrow and see the key you used to deploy).

You can delete your history by typing:

```Solidity
history -c
```
---
### Deploy a smart contract locally using Anvil via scripts

Deploying a smart contract via scripting is particularly handy because it provides a consistent and repeatable way to deploy reliably and its features enhance the testing of both the deployment processes and the code itself.

In Foundry we keep our scripts in the `script` folder.

Create a new file called `DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol`.
Using `.s.sol` as a suffix is a naming convention for Foundry scripts, sometimes we use `.t.sol`.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";

```solidity
contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script {
    function run() external returns (SimpleStorage) {
        vm.startBroadcast();

        SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();

        vm.stopBroadcast();
        return simpleStorage;
    }
```

}

For it to be considered a Foundry script and to be able to access the extended functionality Foundry is bringing to the table we need to import `Script` from `"forge-std/Script.sol"` and make `DeploySimpleStorage` inherit `Script`.

**NOTE**: `forge-std` also called Forge Standard Library is a collection of pre-written Solidity contracts designed to simplify and enhance scripting and testing within the Foundry development framework.

Furthermore, to be able to deploy `SimpleStorage` we also need to import it by typing `import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";`

Every script needs a main function, which, according to the best practice linked above is called `run`. Whenever you run `forge script` this is the function that gets called.

`run` is an external function that will return the `SimpleStorage` contract.

In the Run function, we are going to use a distinctive keyword: `vm`. Foundry has a distinctive feature known as cheat codes. The `vm` keyword is a cheat code in Foundry, and thereby only works in Foundry.

`vm.startBroadcast` indicates the starting point for the list of transactions that get to be sent to the `RPC URL`;

Similarly, `vm.stopBroadcast` indicates the ending point of the list of transactions that get to be sent to the `RPC URL`;

Between those two we write:

`SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();`

The `new` keyword is used to create a new smart contract in Solidity.

Please select the `Anvil` terminal and press `CTRL(CMD) + C` to stop it. Now run the following command


```bash
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol
```
This should go through without any errors, but if you hit some errors related to `incompatible solidity versions in various files`

You should get the following output:
```bash
[⠆] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 2 files with 0.8.19

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

**The million-dollar question**: If we didn't pass an RPC URL, where did this deploy to?

If the RPC URL is not specified, Foundry automatically launches an Anvil instance, runs your script (in our case deployed the contract) and then terminates the Anvil instance.

Run the `anvil` command in the terminal, open up a new terminal and type the following:

```bash
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

```bash

```

Is it deployed now?

Answer: No, the output indicates this was a simulation. But, we got a new folder out of this, the `broadcast` folder contains information about different script runs in case we forget details.

Hit the up arrow key and add `--broadcast --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` at the end.

Our contract is now successfully deployed! Fantastic!

Switch to the `anvil` terminal where you'll see:

```text

```

### blockchain transactions
a transaction captures details of an activity that has taken place on a blockchain.

On the left side of your screen, in the Explorer tab, you'll find a folder called `broadcast`. Foundry saves all your blockchain interactions here. The `dry-run` folder is used for interactions you made when you didn't have a blockchain running (remember that time when we deployed our contract without specifying an `--rpc-url`). Moreover, the recordings here are separated by `chainId`.

**Note**: The `chainId` is a unique identifier assigned to a specific blockchain network. It is used to distinguish one blockchain from another and is a crucial parameter for ensuring the security and integrity of transactions and interactions on the blockchain.

Click on `run-latest.json`.
Here we can find more details about the last deployment script we ran in our previous lesson. It will show things like `transactionType`, `contractName` and `contractAddress`. Moreover, in the `transaction` section, you can see what we actually sent over to the RPC URL:

```json
   "transaction": {
        "from": "0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266",
        "to": null,
        "gas": "0x714e1",
        "value": "0x0",
        "input": "0x608060...c63430008130033",
        "nonce": "0x0",
        "chainId": "0x7a69",
        "accessList": null,
        "type": null

      }
```

Let's go through each of these:

* `from` is self-explanatory, it's the address we used to sign the transaction;
* `to` is the recipient, in our case is null or address(0), this is the standard destination for when new smart contracts are deployed;
* `gas` is the amount of gas spent. You will see the hex value `0x714e1` (or any other value represented in hex format);

**Quick tip**: Normal humans can't understand hex values like the one indicated above, but there's a quick way to convert these into usual numbers. Run the following command in your terminal: `cast --to-base 0x714e1 dec`. `cast` is a very versatile tool provided by Foundry, type `cast --help` in your terminal to find out more, or go [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast).

* `value` is the transaction value, or the amount of ETH we are sending over. Given that this transaction was made to deploy a contract, the value here is `0x0` or `0`, but we could have specified a value and that would have been the initial balance of the newly deployed contract;

* `data` in this case is the contract deployment code and the contract code. In the excerpt above this was truncated;

* `nonce` is a unique identifier assigned to each transaction sent from a specific account. The nonce is used to ensure that each transaction is processed only once and to prevent replay attacks. `nonce` is incremented with every single transaction;

* `accessList` is a feature of Ethereum to optimize the gas cost of transactions. It contains a list of addresses and associated storage keys that the transaction is likely to access, allowing the EVM to more efficiently compute the gas cost of storage access during the transaction's execution;

* `type` please ignore this for now.

There are other values that play an important part that weren't presented in that list, namely the `v`, `r`, and `s`. These are components of a transaction's signature, which are used to validate the authenticity and integrity of the transaction.

Whenever we send a transaction over the blockchain there's a signature happening, that's where we use our `private key`.

**Important:** Every time you change the state of the blockchain you do it using a transaction. The thing that indicates the change is the `data` field of a transaction.&#x20;

### How to not have your private key in the command line
Having our private key in plain text is very bad. What can we do to avoid this, except using the `--interactive` parameter, because we don't want to keep copy-pasting our private key?

**BIG BOLDED DISCLAIMER: What we are about to do is fine for development purposes, do not put a real key here, it very terrible for production purposes.**

Create a new file in the root of your project called `.env`. Then, go the `.gitignore` file and make sure `.env` is in there.

The `.env` file will host environment variables. Variables that are of a sensitive nature that we don't want to expose in public.

Open the file and put the following in it:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80

RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
```
Next run `source .env`. This adds the above-mentioned environment variables into our shell. Now run `echo $PRIVATE_KEY` or `echo $RPC_URL` to check if the values are stored in the shell.

Now we can safely replace the parameters in our `forge script` command:

```bash
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
This doesn't only hide your private key from plain sight in the command line but also facilitates faster terminal usage, imagine you'd have to copy-paste the `http://127.0.0.1:8545` RPC URL over and over again. It's cleaner this way.

But yes, now we have the private key in plain text in the `.env` file, that's not good.

### How to handle this problem with production code?

Foundry has a very nice option called `keystore`. To read more about it type `forge script --help` in your terminal. Using `forge script --keystore <PATH>` allows you to specify a path to an encrypted store file, encrypted by a password. Thus your private key would never be available in plain text.

Let's agree to the following:

1. For testing purposes use a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in an `.env` file as long as you don't expose that `.env` file anywhere.
2. Where real money is involved use the `--interactive` option or a [keystore file protected by a password](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23?tab=readme-ov-file#can-you-encrypt-a-private-key---a-keystore-in-foundry-yet).
---
### Encrypting your Keys Using ERC2335
Type the following command in your terminal:
```bash
cast wallet import nameOfAccountGoesHere --interactive
```
You will be asked for your private key and a password to secure it. You will do this only once.
To see all the configured wallets you can call the following: `cast wallet list`
It will display all the keys.

Now that we configured our wallet we can deploy as following:

```Solidity
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --account nameOfAccountGoesHere --sender 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266
```
You will be asked for your password. You won't be able to deploy without your password.

where, nameOfAccountGoesHere=default name of the account(you can check all the accounts using:`cast wallet list`)->it holds the encrypted private key
0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266=account public address

Clear your history so your private key won't randomly remain there using the following command: `history -c`(for bash terminal)(`history -p` for zsh).

---
### Interacting With Contract Addresses via Command Line & Foundry's Cast Tool
We have `Anvil` running and the smart contract is deployed.

Copy the contract address.

### Sending information to the blockchain

Foundry has a built-in tool known as `Cast`. `Cast` comes loaded with numerous commands to interact with. Learn more about them by typing `cast --help`. One such useful command is `send` which is designed to sign and publish a transaction. To view help about `send`, type `cast send --help`.

To use `send` we need a signature and some arguments.

Please call the following in your terminal:
```bash
cast send 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 "store(uint256)" 1337 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
**What did we just do?**

Let's break it down:

* `cast send` is the command we used to sign and publish our transaction;
* `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3` or any other address is the target of our `cast send`, the contract we are interacting with;
* `"store(uint256)"` is the [signature of the function](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/135205/what-is-a-function-signature-and-function-selector-in-solidity-and-evm-language) we are calling.
* `1337` is the number we pass to the `store` function. As we can see in the function signature, we are expected to provide an `uint256` input. You can obviously provide any number you want, as long as it fits `uint256`.
* you already know what `--rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY` are. The place where we send and the private key we use to sign.

### Reading information from the blockchain

`cast` conveniently provides a way to read information stored on the blockchain. Type `cast call --help` in your terminal to find out more. It works similarly to `send`, where you have to provide a signature and some arguments. The difference is you are only peering into the storage, not modifying it.

Call the following command in your terminal:
```bash
cast call 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 "retrieve()"
```

We receive back the following:

```Solidity
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000539
```

This represents a hex value. In the previous lessons, we learned how to convert this to a normal number.

Type the following command in your terminal:

```Solidity
cast --to-base 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000539 dec
```

And surprise, surprise, `1337` came back.

### Deploying our Contract to Testnet or Live Network with Foundry and Alchemy

we need an actual testnet for a real network. But our trusty MetaMask has built-in Infura connections that are incompatible. Why? Because they're tailored specifically for MetaMask. Hence, we need our own Remote Procedure Call (RPC) URL.

## Creating our Own RPC URL for a Testnet

_To create one, we could run our own blockchain node, but let's be honest — many folks prefer avoiding that route. Instead, we utilize Node as a Service (NaaS) applications to expedite the process._

One promising option is using Alchemy - a free NaaS platform that we can send the transactions to. This procedure resides within the _Deploying to Testnet or Mainnnet_ section in the full course repo of the Foundry.

next step is creating a new app in the Alchemy user interface. I named mine _Sepolia Testing_ and kept the description the same, given that our chain will be an Ethereum one based on Ethiopia.

We can bypass advanced features for now and finalize our app. Now we have the app details needed for our node, including frequency of calls and other details. We also have a new https endpoint by clicking view key, which functions exactly the same way as our ganache or MetaMask endpoint.

## Altering our Private Key

Next, let's do something about our private keys. Our ganache private key will no longer cut it — it has neither real money nor any testnet ETH in it.

Our solution is to use one of our MetaMask private keys. To do this, we switch back to Sepolia in our MetaMask, choose an account with money in it, click on account details, and export the private key. _Remember, never share your real private key!_

Upon confirmation with your password, copy the private key and omit the line in the env file — hashtag or pound sign denoting comments.

<img width="916" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-21 at 12 31 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c60b7cf4-a51b-4e1f-9a30-a1db90913aa3" />

## Executing the Transaction

With our Sepolia RPC URL and private key from MetaMask, executing a transaction now becomes tremendously easier.

```bash
source .env
forge script script/deploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url=$Sepolia_RPC_URL --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

This command deploys our contract to the testnet, and we can monitor the transaction on our Alchemy dashboard.

We soon find that our contract, Simple Storage, has been deployed on the Sepolia chain. We can grab our transaction hash and input it into Sepolia etherscan IO to confirm the successful transaction.

After we refresh our Alchemy dashboard, we'll verify the requests sent and track the ETH send raw transaction that transmitted our transaction to the blockchain.

```forge build --zksync```

The command `forge build --zksync` is used with **Forge**, a tool from the **Foundry** framework for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. The `--zksync` flag specifically targets compatibility with **zkSync**, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

Here’s what it does:

### **1. Compiles Smart Contracts**
The `forge build` command:
- Compiles all the Solidity smart contracts in your project.
- Produces bytecode, ABI (Application Binary Interface), and other artifacts for your contracts.
- Ensures the contracts are ready for deployment or testing.

---

### **2. zkSync Compatibility**
The `--zksync` flag modifies the compilation process to ensure that the resulting smart contracts are compatible with zkSync's unique execution environment. Specifically:

- **zkSync Opcodes Support:** Adjusts the compiled bytecode to use zkSync's specific opcodes and Layer 2 optimizations.
- **Account Abstraction:** zkSync uses account abstraction by default, and this flag ensures the compiled contracts are ready to interact with zkSync’s native account model.
- **Custom Precompiles and Features:** Includes support for zkSync-specific precompiled contracts and features not present on Ethereum Layer 1.
- **Optimized Gas and Costs:** Compiles with settings tailored to zkSync’s gas model, which differs from Ethereum Layer 1.

---

### **3. Outputs Compiled Artifacts**
The command outputs the following artifacts:
- **Bytecode:** The deployable code for your smart contracts.
- **ABI Files:** Descriptions of the contract interfaces for integration with frontends or scripts.
- These files are typically stored in the `out/` directory by default.

---

### **When to Use `forge build --zksync`**
Use this command when:
- You're developing contracts specifically for deployment on the zkSync network.
- You want to leverage zkSync's scalability benefits (lower fees and faster transactions).

If you’re targeting Ethereum or another Layer 2 that doesn’t use zkSync's environment, you can omit the `--zksync` flag.

###ZKSync local node
### Introduction

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT**:br
> This lesson is optional. If you encounter difficulties installing or understanding the required tools, feel free to proceed to the next section and continue using Anvil to test your smart contract locally.

In the previous lessons, we learned about deploying smart contracts with the `forge create` and `forge script` commands on our **local Anvil chain**. In this lesson, we will set up and run a **ZKsync local environment**.

### Local Node Setup

To deploy locally on a ZKsync local chain, you'll need additional tools: Docker, Node.js, and zksync-cli.

1. **Docker**: Start the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) daemon. On Mac OS, you can start it using the Docker application interface. On Linux, use commands like `sudo systemctl start docker` and `sudo systemctl stop docker` will manage Docker lifecycles. Verify the installation with `docker --version` and `docker ps` commands.

2. **Node.js and npm**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Follow the Node.js documentation to install the right version for your operating system. Verify the installations with `npm --version` and `node --version` commands.

3. **zksync-cli**: Once Docker and Node.js are installed, you can install the [zksync-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zksync-cli) to manage your local ZKsync development environment. Run `npx zksync-cli dev config` to set up your configuration. Choose the `in-memory` node option for a quick startup without persistent state and avoid additional options like a portal or block explorer unless you want to explore them independently.

To start your local ZKsync node, run `npx zksync-cli dev start`. This command spins up a ZKsync node in Docker and runs it in the background. Verify the process is running with `docker ps`.

> 🗒️ **NOTE**:br
> If Docker isn’t running, the `npx zksync-cli dev start` command will fail. Ensure Docker is running before attempting to start the ZKsync node again.

### Deployment

The ZKsync deployment process is similar to previous deployments. We will use the same commands, but this time, we will append the `--zksync` and `--legacy` flags. Note that the `forge script` command is not well supported in ZKsync, so we will use `forge create` instead.

### Conclusion

Setting up a local ZKsync node involves a few additional tools, including Docker, Node.js, npm, and zksync-cli: they will help creating a robust ZKsync development environment and allowing test and deployment of smart contracts on a ZKsync local chain.

### ZKSync local deploy
In this lesson, we are going to deploy the contract `SimpleStorage.sol` on a **ZKsync local chain**.

We start by verifying that the Forge version we are using is correct. By running the `forge --version` command it confirms that we are on version 0.2: this indicates we are using the right Foundry ZKsync edition.

Next, we proceed with creating a `SimpleStorage` contract using the command:

```bash
forge create src/SimpleStorage.sol:SimpleStorage --rpc_url <RPC_URL> --private_key <PRIVATE_KEY> --legacy --zksync
```

Here, `<RPC_URL>` represents ZKsync node address, such as `http://127.0.0.1:8011`.

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT**:br
> Including private keys directly in commands is not a safe practice.

This command instructs Foundry to locate the `SimpleStorage` contract in the `src/SimpleStorage.sol` file and deploy it. Upon execution, the contract compiles and deploys successfully. The output will display details such as the deployer, the deployed contract address, and the transaction hash.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f0529e2-13e6-48c4-ada9-95fc62cda4f7)

Using the `--legacy` flag is recommended for deploying simple contracts, while more complex codebases may require different approaches. Attempting to deploy without the `--legacy` flag might result in errors like `failed to serialize transaction, address to address is null`, which will be covered in future lessons.

Once you are finished, you can close Docker Desktop and revert to the Vanilla Foundry environment using the `foundryup` command.

### Transaction types-legacy, EIP-2930, EIP-1559, and EIP-712
### `/broadcast` Folder

When deploying to a ZKsync local node, a `/broadcast` folder will be created and it will contain detailed information about the **deployment transactions**. Inside this folder, you will find subfolders named after specific deployment chain IDs, such as **`260`** for ZKsync and **`31337`** for Anvil. These subfolders store the data of the transactions executed during the deployment process.

By examining both the `run-latest.json` file in these folders, we can observe different **transaction types** for each transaction within a chain. For instance, transactions on the Anvil chain might be labeled as type **`0x2`**, while those on the ZKsync chain will be of type **`0x0`**. Deploying a smart contract on the EVM without the `--legacy` flag results in a default transaction type of `0x2`. Adding the `--legacy` flag changes it to type `0x0`.

The EVM and ZKsync ecosystems support multiple transaction types to accommodate various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Initially, Ethereum had only one transaction type (`0x0` legacy), but as the ecosystem evolved, multiple types were introduced through various EIPs. Subsequent types include type 1, which introduces an _access list_ of addresses and keys, and type 2, also known as [EIP 1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transactions.

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT**:br
> This `0x2` type is the current default type for the EVM.

Additionally, ZKsync introduces its [unique transaction type](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/transaction-lifecycle#eip-712-0x71), the type `113` (`0x71` in hex), which can enable features like [account abstraction](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/account-abstraction/).

> 💡 **TIP**:br
> The `forge script` command will work in some scenarios, but it’s not entirely clear where it might fail.
