### Transaction Fields

During a value transfer, a transaction will contain the following fields:

* Nonce: transaction counter for the account
* Gas price (wei)**: maximum price that the sender is willing to pay _per unit of gas_
* Gas Limit: maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to use for the transaction. A common value could be around 21000.
* To: _recipient's address_
* Value (Wei): amount of cryptocurrency to be transferred to the recipient
* Data: ðŸ«™ _empty_
* v,r,s: components of the transaction signature. They prove that the transaction is authorised by the sender.

During a _**contract interaction transaction**_, it will instead be populated with:

* Nonce: transaction counter for the account
* Gas price (wei): maximum price that the sender is willing to pay _per unit of gas_
* Gas Limit: maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to use for the transaction. A common value could be around 21000.
* To: _address the transaction is sent to (e.g. smart contract)_
* Value (Wei): amount of cryptocurrency to be transferred to the recipient
* Data: ðŸ“¦ _the content to send to the_ _**To**_ _address_, e.g. a function and its parameters.
* v,r,s: components of the transaction signature. They prove that the transaction is authorised by the sender.

### Conclusion

"Reverts" and "gas" usage help maintain the integrity of the blockchain state. 
_Reverts_ will undo transactions when failures occur, while _gas_ enables transactions execution and runs the EVM. 
When a transaction fails, the gas consumed is not recoverable. To manage this, Ethereum allows users to set the maximum amount of gas they're willing to pay for each transaction.

##Questions##
Bob sets his gas price to 20 Gwei and his gas limit to 50,000 units. 
The transaction consumes 30,000 units of gas before a revert occurs. How much ETH will be effectively charged?

Solution : 1 Eth = 10^9 Gwei
1 Gwei=1*10^-9 ETH
20*30000 Gwei= 600000 * 10^-9 = 0.0006 ETH
